LilyTiny/LilyTwinkle

LilyTiny and LilyTwinkle are ATTiny85-based development
boards for eTextiles applications. Due to the small size
of the board and hardware limitations of the processor,
they do not have a bootloader like a conventional LilyPad
Arduino compatible does. Instead, six pads are available
in the center of the back side of the board, allowing it
to be reprogrammed with a standard AVR ISP programmer
simply by inserting male headers into the end of the
programming cable and pressing them against the board.

The Tiny and the Twinkle are identical boards; for
simplicity's sake, the hardware files are named "LilyTiny".
There are two different firmware folders, however.

The high-low tech group at MIT has a great tutorial on
adding support for the ATTiny85 to the Arduino IDE:

You'll need to follow these steps before attempting to
write new code for your ATTiny.
